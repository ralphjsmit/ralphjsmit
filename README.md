### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ralph

I'm an 18yo developer and I'm an enthusiastic Laravel developer.

Usually I spend my time doing freelance work and my university study (Business Economics).
In the meantime I also write about PHP, Laravel, Tailwind & more on my personal blog, [ralphjsmit.com](https://ralphjsmit.com).
