### Hi there üëã I'm Ralph

I'm a freelance Laravel-developer, working on a wide variety of projects & packages. Over time, I have worked for clients ranging from small-scale startups to large enterprises, each with their own own environment and constraints. 

I love to create Laravel-packages. My most popular open-source package is the [**ralphjsmit/laravel-seo**](https://github.com/ralphjsmit/laravel-seo) package, also featured on Laravel News. I'm also a regular contributor to [_Filament PHP_](https://filamentphp.com) and its ecosystem with plugins and PRs. I'm also the author of eight premium packages for Filament, among them: [**Filament Media Library**](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/ralphjsmit-media-library-manager), [**Filament Activitylog Pro**](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/ralphjsmit-activitylog-pro), [**Filament Onboarding**](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/onboarding-manager-pro) and [**Filament Upload Pro**](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/ralphjsmit-upload-pro). You can find the full catalogue of plugins on my website [**ralphjsmit.com/filament-plugins**](ralphjsmit.com/filament-plugins). Furthermore, I also run a popular newsletter about Filament PHP, called [**Filament Biweekly**](https://ralphjsmit.com/filament-biweekly).

I enjoy open source contributions, so occassionaly you may see PRs from me to Laravel or a package‚ö°Ô∏è

Recently I also graduated with an MSc Information Management, complementing my experience as a software developer.
