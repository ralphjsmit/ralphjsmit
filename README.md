### Hi there üëã I'm Ralph

I'm an 18yo enthusiastic Laravel developer.

Usually I spend my time doing freelance work and my university study (Business Economics).
In the meantime I also write about PHP, Laravel, Tailwind & more on my personal blog, [ralphjsmit.com](https://ralphjsmit.com). (If you're interested, subscribe to my newsletter to occassionally receive an email with some updates.)

I'm also discovering open source contributions, so occassionally you may see a PR from me somewhere.‚ö°Ô∏è
