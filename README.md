### Hi there üëã I'm Ralph

I'm a Laravel-developer. Usually I spend my time doing freelance work and my university study (Business Economics).
In the meantime I also write about PHP, Laravel, Tailwind & more on my personal blog, [**ralphjsmit.com**](https://ralphjsmit.com). (If you're interested, subscribe to my newsletter to occassionaly receive an email with some updates.)

I love to create Laravel-packages. My most popular open-source package is the [**ralphjsmit/laravel-seo**](https://github.com/ralphjsmit/laravel-seo) package, also featured on Laravel News. I'm also a regular contributor to [_Filament PHP_](https://filamentphp.com) and its ecosystem with plugins and PRs. I'm also the author of three premium packages for Filament: [**Filament Media Library**](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/media-library-pro), [**Filament Onboarding**](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/onboarding-manager-pro) and [**Filament Notifications Pro**](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/notifications-pro).

I also enjoy open source contributions, so occassionaly you may see PRs from me to Laravel or a package‚ö°Ô∏è
