### Hi there üëã I'm Ralph

I'm a 19yo Laravel developer.

Usually I spend my time doing freelance work and my university study (Business Economics).
In the meantime I also write about PHP, Laravel, Tailwind & more on my personal blog, [**ralphjsmit.com**](https://ralphjsmit.com). (If you're interested, subscribe to my newsletter to occassionally receive an email with some updates.)

I love to create Laravel-packages. My most popular package is the [**ralphjsmit/laravel-seo**](https://github.com/ralphjsmit/laravel-seo) package and the premium [**Filament Media Library Manager**](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/media-library-pro) plugin.

I'm also discovering open source contributions, so occassionally you may see a PR to Laravel or a package‚ö°Ô∏è
